# Single-Cell Multi-Omics Dissects Transcript Isoform and Immune Repertoire Dynamics in Human Immunosenescence
We present the human peripheral immune single-cell multi-omics atlas integrating gene expression, transcript isoforms, and immune receptor sequences. By combining single-cell full-length transcriptome sequencing (scCycloneSEQ), short-read scRNA-seq, single-cell TCR/BCR sequencing (scTCR/BCR-seq), we systematically profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from young and elderly healthy donors.
